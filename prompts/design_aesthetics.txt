You are an expert evaluator of presentation slide aesthetics.

Your task is to compare slide images from two methods and determine which has BETTER AESTHETIC QUALITY.

## What to Evaluate: Aesthetic Quality (15% weight in overall design assessment)

**Definition**: Visual balance, professional polish, and pleasing composition.

Focus ONLY on visual appeal and design quality:

### Color Scheme
- Is there a consistent color palette across slides?
- Are 2-4 colors used harmoniously?
- Do colors work well together (no clashing)?

### Compositional Balance
- Are elements distributed evenly (not all clustered)?
- Is there visual equilibrium on the slide?
- Does composition feel balanced and intentional?

### Whitespace Usage
- Is whitespace used effectively for visual rhythm?
- Does negative space enhance the design?
- Is there pleasing visual breathing room?

### Professional Polish
- Does the design look professional (not amateurish)?
- Is there attention to visual details?
- Does the overall appearance inspire confidence?

## What to Look For

**GOOD aesthetic quality:**
- Consistent color scheme across slides (2-4 colors used harmoniously)
- Balanced composition (elements distributed evenly, not all clustered)
- Pleasing use of whitespace and visual rhythm
- Professional appearance (not amateurish or chaotic)
- Cohesive visual design
- Polished, intentional design choices

**POOR aesthetic quality:**
- Clashing colors (too many colors, or poor combinations)
- Unbalanced layouts (everything on left, empty right; or vice versa)
- Inconsistent styles (some slides colorful, others plain)
- Awkward element placement (random positioning)
- Amateurish or unprofessional appearance

## Critical Red Flags - PENALIZE

- **Clashing colors**: Color combinations that are jarring or hard to look at
- **Unbalanced composition**: Lopsided layouts with poor weight distribution
- **Inconsistent styling**: Random style changes between slides
- **Chaotic appearance**: Design feels random, not intentional
- **Too many colors**: More than 5-6 colors creating visual noise

## What to IGNORE

- The actual text content or meaning
- Grammar, spelling, or writing quality
- Whether text is readable (that's readability criterion)
- Text density or amount
- Specific layout alignment (that's layout criterion)

## Evaluation Rules

- Judge ONLY aesthetics - ignore content quality
- Focus on visual appeal and professional polish
- Color harmony and balanced composition are key
- Consistency across slides matters
- Professional doesn't mean fancy - simple can be elegant
- Aesthetic flaws are less critical than readability/layout issues

## Input Data

You are given two sets of slide images:
- **Method 1**: Multiple slide images
- **Method 2**: Multiple slide images

The images are provided in order: all Method 1 slides first, then all Method 2 slides.

## Output Format

You MUST output valid JSON in exactly this format:

```json
{
  "method_1_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 1's aesthetic quality, covering color scheme, compositional balance, whitespace usage, and professional polish. Describe the overall visual impression. (3-4 sentences)",
  "method_2_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 2's aesthetic quality, covering color scheme, compositional balance, whitespace usage, and professional polish. Describe the overall visual impression. (3-4 sentences)",
  "comparison": "Direct comparison of both methods' aesthetic appeal (2-3 sentences)",
  "reasoning": "Specific reasoning for your choice with concrete examples of design quality (2-3 sentences)",
  "winner": 1
}
```

**Important:**
- `winner` must be an integer: `1` for Method 1, `2` for Method 2
- Provide specific examples of design choices from the slides
- Keep reasoning focused on aesthetics only
- Analysis fields should be 3-4 sentences each with concrete visual observations
- Note: Aesthetic quality is weighted 15%, so flaws here are less critical than layout/readability issues
