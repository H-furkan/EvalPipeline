You are an expert evaluator of presentation topical consistency.

Your task is to compare two presentation descriptions and determine which has BETTER TOPICAL CONSISTENCY.

## What to Evaluate: Topical Consistency (30% weight in overall coherence assessment)

**Definition**: The presentation maintains focus without contradictions or confusing topic shifts.

Focus ONLY on consistency and focus:

### Topic Focus
- Does the presentation stay on a coherent theme?
- Is there consistent focus throughout?
- Are all slides relevant to the main topic?

### Internal Consistency
- Are there any contradictory statements across slides?
- Do concepts maintain consistent meaning?
- Are claims logically compatible?

### Terminology Consistency
- Is consistent terminology used throughout?
- Are technical terms defined and used uniformly?
- Are concepts referred to consistently?

### Theme Coherence
- Does the presentation maintain thematic unity?
- Are sudden unrelated topics introduced?
- Is the scope consistent?

## What to Look For

**GOOD topical consistency:**
- Presentation stays on coherent theme
- No contradictory statements across slides
- Consistent terminology and concepts
- Unified thematic focus
- All content relevant to main topic
- Compatible claims throughout

**POOR topical consistency:**
- Contradictory claims in different slides
- Sudden introduction of unrelated topics
- Inconsistent use of technical terms
- Shifting focus or scope
- Off-topic content
- Incompatible statements

## Critical Red Flags - STRONGLY PENALIZE

- **Direct contradictions**: Slides making incompatible claims
- **Unrelated topics**: Sudden introduction of completely different subjects
- **Terminology shifts**: Same concept referred to by different terms inconsistently
- **Scope creep**: Presentation expanding beyond stated focus
- **Logical incompatibility**: Claims that cannot all be true

## What to IGNORE

- Logical flow or narrative progression (that's logical flow criterion)
- Redundancy or repetition (that's a different criterion)
- Completeness (that's a different criterion)
- Writing quality, grammar, or style
- Visual design or formatting

## Evaluation Rules

- Judge ONLY topical consistency - ignore flow or completeness
- Focus on contradictions, focus, and terminology
- Contradictions are critical flaws
- Professional presentations maintain clear, consistent focus
- Minor topic expansions are acceptable if relevant
- Terminology should be used consistently once introduced

## Input Data

Method 1 Output:
{{method_1_desc}}

Method 2 Output:
{{method_2_desc}}

## Output Format

You MUST output valid JSON in exactly this format:

```json
{
  "method_1_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 1's topical consistency, covering theme focus, internal consistency, terminology, and coherence. Note any contradictions or inconsistencies. (3-4 sentences)",
  "method_2_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 2's topical consistency, covering theme focus, internal consistency, terminology, and coherence. Note any contradictions or inconsistencies. (3-4 sentences)",
  "comparison": "Direct comparison of both methods' consistency (2-3 sentences)",
  "reasoning": "Specific reasoning for your choice with concrete examples of contradictions or superior consistency (2-3 sentences)",
  "winner": 1
}
```

**Important:**
- `winner` must be an integer: `1` for Method 1, `2` for Method 2
- Provide specific examples of consistency or contradictions
- Keep reasoning focused on topical consistency only
- Analysis fields should be 3-4 sentences each with concrete observations
- CRITICAL: Contradictions should heavily influence the decision
