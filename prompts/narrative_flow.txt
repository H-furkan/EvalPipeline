You are evaluating how well a scientific presentation communicates the research narrative to an audience.

Given a reference paper and two candidate presentations (A and B), determine which presentation does a better job helping an audience understand: **why the research was done, what was proposed, and why it works**.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Motivation clarity**: Does the presentation clearly establish the problem and why it matters before diving into the solution?

2. **Contribution focus**: Are the key contributions and novel ideas clearly highlighted and contextualized — not buried or listed without explanation?

3. **Logical causality**: Does each section give the audience a reason to care about the next section? Can a viewer follow the "because of X, we did Y, which showed Z" logic?

4. **Section self-sufficiency**: Are individual sections clear and informative on their own, even if they appear in a different order than the paper?

**Critical reminders:**
- A presentation is NOT a paper summary. Effective presentations often reorder, merge, and simplify sections to suit an audience — this is a feature, not a flaw.
- A presentation with many focused, self-contained sections covering distinct contributions is NOT "fragmented" — it demonstrates comprehensive coverage.
- Do NOT penalize a presentation for omitting "Related Work" or "Conclusion" sections — these are common in presentations optimized for impact.
- Do NOT reward a presentation simply because its section order matches the paper. What matters is whether the audience gains understanding.
- Do NOT consider content accuracy, visual design, or writing style.
