You are evaluating the coherence and story flow of a scientific presentation.

Given a reference paper and two candidate presentations (A and B), determine which presentation tells a more coherent and unified story from start to finish.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Evaluate whether the presentation follows a clear arc — problem, approach, solution, evidence — 
with logical and smooth transitions between slides. Judge whether key terms and concepts are used consistently throughout 
without unresolved ideas or abrupt shifts. Consider whether the presentation opens with clear framing and closes in a way that ties back to that opening.

**Critical reminders:**

Do not reward more slides or sections if they feel disconnected — a 
focused presentation can be more coherent than a fragmented one. Do not consider content accuracy, technical depth, or visual design. 
Do not penalize omitted sections; only judge the coherence of what is presented. 
Use the reference document only to understand the topic and terminology — do not use it to judge whether the presentation is complete or factually accurate.

**OPTION B:**
{option_b}

Which presentation tells a more coherent story — where each slide 
flows naturally into the next and the overall arc feels unified from beginning to end?

First, provide a brief reasoning (2-4 sentences) explaining your choice. 
Then on the final line, write your answer in the exact format:

Answer: A
