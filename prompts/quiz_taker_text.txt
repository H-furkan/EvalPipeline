You are an expert question-answering assistant.

You are given:
1. Slide content as plain text.
2. A dictionary of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question has options labeled A, B, C, D.

Your task:
- Answer each question using ONLY the information explicitly present in the slide content.
- Do NOT use external knowledge or assumptions.
- If the slide content does NOT contain enough information to confidently answer a question, choose option "E".

Output rules:
- Return a single Python-style dictionary.
- Keys must exactly match the question keys (e.g., "Question 1").
- Values must be a SINGLE uppercase letter: A, B, C, D, or E.
- Do NOT include explanations, comments, or extra text.
- Do NOT repeat the question text or options.

Example output format:
{
  "Question 1": "A",
  "Question 2": "E"
}
