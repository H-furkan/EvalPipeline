You are an expert evaluator of presentation logical flow.

Your task is to compare two presentation descriptions and determine which has BETTER LOGICAL FLOW.

## What to Evaluate: Logical Progression (30% weight in overall coherence assessment)

**Definition**: Each slide builds naturally on the previous slide, creating a clear narrative flow.

Focus ONLY on the progression and connections between slides:

### Slide-to-Slide Connections
- Does each slide connect logically to the next?
- Are transitions smooth and justified?
- Is there clear reasoning for the sequence?

### Narrative Flow
- Is there a clear "story arc" from beginning to end?
- Do ideas build progressively?
- Is the progression natural and easy to follow?

### Argument Development
- Are intermediate steps present in the argument?
- Does the presentation build toward conclusions logically?
- Are prerequisite concepts introduced before dependent ones?

### Transition Quality
- Are topic shifts smooth or abrupt?
- Do transitions make sense?
- Is the audience guided through the progression?

## What to Look For

**GOOD logical progression:**
- Each slide connects logically to the next
- Clear "story arc" from beginning to end
- Smooth transitions between topics
- Prerequisite concepts before dependent ones
- Natural, easy-to-follow flow
- Progressive building of ideas

**POOR logical progression:**
- Slides that seem randomly ordered
- Abrupt jumps between unrelated topics
- Missing intermediate steps in argument
- Illogical sequencing
- Confusing progression
- No clear narrative thread

## Critical Red Flags - STRONGLY PENALIZE

- **Random ordering**: Slides could be shuffled with no loss of coherence
- **Abrupt jumps**: Sudden topic changes with no connection
- **Missing steps**: Logical gaps in argument development
- **Backward flow**: Later concepts introduced before prerequisites
- **No progression**: Slides feel like disconnected points, not a narrative

## What to IGNORE

- Writing quality, grammar, or style
- Content completeness (that's a different criterion)
- Redundancy or repetition (that's a different criterion)
- Contradictions (that's topical consistency)
- Visual design or formatting

## Evaluation Rules

- Judge ONLY logical progression - ignore other coherence aspects
- Focus on slide-to-slide connections and narrative flow
- Read descriptions sequentially to assess flow
- Missing logical steps are serious flaws
- Natural progression is essential for effective presentations
- Consider whether slide order makes sense or feels arbitrary

## Input Data

Method 1 Output:
{{method_1_desc}}

Method 2 Output:
{{method_2_desc}}

## Output Format

You MUST output valid JSON in exactly this format:

```json
{
  "method_1_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 1's logical progression, covering slide-to-slide connections, narrative flow, and argument development. Provide specific examples of transitions. (3-4 sentences)",
  "method_2_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 2's logical progression, covering slide-to-slide connections, narrative flow, and argument development. Provide specific examples of transitions. (3-4 sentences)",
  "comparison": "Direct comparison of both methods' logical flow quality (2-3 sentences)",
  "reasoning": "Specific reasoning for your choice with concrete examples of superior or inferior progression (2-3 sentences)",
  "winner": 1
}
```

**Important:**
- `winner` must be an integer: `1` for Method 1, `2` for Method 2
- Provide specific examples of slide sequences and transitions
- Keep reasoning focused on logical progression only
- Analysis fields should be 3-4 sentences each with concrete observations
- Read through entire presentation description to assess flow
