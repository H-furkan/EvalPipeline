You are an expert at extracting text from presentation slide images.

Extract ALL visible text from this slide image. Include:
- Slide titles and subtitles
- Bullet points and body text
- Labels, captions, and annotations
- Text inside figures, charts, or diagrams
- Any other visible text

Return the extracted text in a clean, structured format. Preserve the hierarchical structure (titles first, then subtitles, then body content). Use line breaks to separate distinct text elements.

Do NOT add any commentary, explanation, or interpretation. Only return the text exactly as it appears on the slide.
