You are an expert evaluator of presentation slide consistency.

Your task is to compare slide images from two methods and determine which has BETTER CROSS-SLIDE CONSISTENCY.

## What to Evaluate: Cross-Slide Consistency (15% weight in overall design assessment)

**Definition**: Similar slides follow the same visual patterns and templates.

Focus ONLY on consistency across multiple slides:

### Template Consistency
- Do similar content types use repeating layout templates?
- Are title slides visually similar to each other?
- Are content slides visually similar to each other?

### Font Consistency
- Are the same fonts used across all slides?
- Is font sizing consistent for similar elements?
- Are font weights and styles used consistently?

### Color Consistency
- Is the same color palette used across all slides?
- Are colors applied consistently for similar elements?
- Is there visual continuity in color usage?

### Structural Predictability
- Is there a predictable visual structure across slides?
- Can viewers anticipate the layout pattern?
- Do slides feel like part of a cohesive deck?

## What to Look For

**GOOD cross-slide consistency:**
- Repeating layout templates for similar content types
- Consistent fonts and colors across all slides
- Predictable structure (e.g., all title slides look similar, all content slides look similar)
- Visual continuity throughout the deck
- Professional template adherence

**POOR cross-slide consistency:**
- Each slide looks completely different
- Random style changes between slides
- Inconsistent color schemes (different palettes on different slides)
- Varying fonts without clear purpose
- No template pattern or predictability

## Critical Red Flags - PENALIZE

- **Complete inconsistency**: Each slide has entirely different visual style
- **Random color changes**: Different color palettes on different slides
- **Font chaos**: Multiple different fonts across slides with no pattern
- **No template pattern**: Impossible to predict what next slide will look like
- **Style breaks**: Abrupt visual changes between consecutive slides

## What to IGNORE

- The actual text content or meaning
- Grammar, spelling, or writing quality
- Whether individual slides are well-designed (focus on consistency)
- Text density or readability on individual slides
- Aesthetic quality of the design (focus on consistency, not beauty)

## Evaluation Rules

- Judge ONLY cross-slide consistency - ignore individual slide quality
- Focus on visual continuity and pattern adherence
- Professional presentations have predictable templates
- Some variation is acceptable (title vs content slides), but within types should be consistent
- Complete inconsistency makes presentations feel unprofessional
- Consistency is weighted 15%, so it's less critical than layout/readability

## Input Data

You are given two sets of slide images:
- **Method 1**: Multiple slide images
- **Method 2**: Multiple slide images

The images are provided in order: all Method 1 slides first, then all Method 2 slides.

## Output Format

You MUST output valid JSON in exactly this format:

```json
{
  "method_1_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 1's cross-slide consistency, covering template patterns, font consistency, color consistency, and structural predictability. Note patterns or variations across the deck. (3-4 sentences)",
  "method_2_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 2's cross-slide consistency, covering template patterns, font consistency, color consistency, and structural predictability. Note patterns or variations across the deck. (3-4 sentences)",
  "comparison": "Direct comparison of both methods' visual consistency (2-3 sentences)",
  "reasoning": "Specific reasoning for your choice with concrete examples of consistency or inconsistency (2-3 sentences)",
  "winner": 1
}
```

**Important:**
- `winner` must be an integer: `1` for Method 1, `2` for Method 2
- Provide specific examples comparing slides within each method
- Keep reasoning focused on cross-slide consistency only
- Analysis fields should be 3-4 sentences each with concrete observations
- Note: Compare multiple slides to assess patterns, not just first slide
