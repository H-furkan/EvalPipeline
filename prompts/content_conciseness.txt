You are an expert evaluator of presentation conciseness and readiness.

Your task is to compare two slide decks and determine which has BETTER PRESENTATION READINESS (conciseness and suitability).

## What to Evaluate: Presentation Readiness (10% weight in overall content assessment)

**Definition**: How suitable the content is for actual presentation delivery (not reading like an academic paper).

Focus ONLY on these aspects:

### Conciseness
- Is content brief enough for slide format?
- Are points succinct and scannable?
- Is there unnecessary verbosity?

### Audience-Appropriate Style
- Is it presentation-style, not document-style?
- Does it use conversational but professional language?
- Is it suited for spoken delivery with visual support?

### Engagement Factor
- Does content invite attention rather than overwhelming?
- Is text scannable at a glance?
- Does it complement (not replace) verbal presentation?

### Brevity Balance
- Is content concise without losing essential information?
- Are explanations appropriately brief for slides?
- Is wordiness minimized?

## What to Look For

**GOOD presentation readiness:**
- Concise, scannable text
- Presentation-friendly language (conversational but professional)
- Content that complements verbal presentation (not replaces it)
- Brief explanations that can be expanded verbally
- Engaging, digestible chunks

**POOR presentation readiness:**
- Overly verbose or academic writing
- Dense text walls that belong in a paper
- Content that reads like a document rather than presentation support
- Paragraph-style explanations
- Language too formal or technical for spoken delivery

## Critical Red Flags - STRONGLY PENALIZE

- **Text walls**: Dense paragraphs that should be in a report, not slides
- **Academic style**: Overly formal, technical writing suited for papers
- **Excessive detail**: Too much explanation that should be spoken, not written
- **Verbose bullets**: Points that could be 5 words but are 25 words
- **Document language**: Writing that assumes reading, not listening

## What to IGNORE

- Text quality, grammar, or spelling
- Slide structure or hierarchy
- Content organization across slides
- Visual design or layout
- The completeness of information (we want concise, not incomplete)

## Evaluation Rules

- Judge ONLY presentation readiness - ignore other content aspects
- Focus on conciseness and presentation suitability
- Academic/document-style writing is inappropriate for slides
- Text should support speech, not replace it
- Brevity is valued, but not at the expense of clarity

## Input Data

Method 1 Slide Content:
{{method_1_content}}

Method 2 Slide Content:
{{method_2_content}}

## Output Format

You MUST output valid JSON in exactly this format:

```json
{
  "method_1_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 1's presentation readiness, covering conciseness, style appropriateness, and engagement. Provide specific examples. (3-4 sentences)",
  "method_2_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 2's presentation readiness, covering conciseness, style appropriateness, and engagement. Provide specific examples. (3-4 sentences)",
  "comparison": "Direct comparison of both methods' suitability for presentation delivery (2-3 sentences)",
  "reasoning": "Specific reasoning for your choice with concrete examples of conciseness or verbosity (2-3 sentences)",
  "winner": 1
}
```

**Important:**
- `winner` must be an integer: `1` for Method 1, `2` for Method 2
- Provide specific examples of concise vs. verbose writing
- Keep reasoning focused on presentation readiness only
- Analysis fields should be 3-4 sentences each with concrete observations
