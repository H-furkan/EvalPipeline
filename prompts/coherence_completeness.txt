You are an expert evaluator of presentation completeness and narrative structure.

Your task is to compare two presentation descriptions and determine which has BETTER NARRATIVE ARC AND COMPLETENESS.

## What to Evaluate: Narrative Arc & Completeness (25% weight + 15% redundancy = 40% combined)

**Definition**: Clear beginning (introduction) → development (main content) → conclusion structure, with efficient information presentation.

Focus on both narrative structure AND information efficiency:

### Narrative Structure
- Is there a distinct introduction that sets context?
- Does the middle develop ideas systematically?
- Is there a conclusion that wraps up key points?

### Introduction Quality
- Does the presentation set proper context at the start?
- Are objectives or scope clearly established?
- Is the audience oriented to the topic?

### Development Quality
- Does the main content build systematically?
- Are ideas developed thoroughly?
- Is there clear progression through the topic?

### Conclusion Quality
- Is there proper closure or summary?
- Are key points wrapped up?
- Does the presentation feel complete?

### Information Efficiency
- Is information presented without unnecessary repetition?
- Does each slide add new value?
- Are key points repeated excessively?

### Redundancy Check
- Are multiple slides saying essentially the same thing?
- Could slides be merged without losing information?
- Is repetition excessive or appropriate for emphasis?

## What to Look For

**GOOD narrative arc & completeness:**
- Clear introduction that sets context
- Systematic development of ideas
- Proper conclusion that wraps up
- Each slide adds new information
- Minimal unnecessary repetition
- Complete coverage without redundancy
- Appropriate emphasis through selective repetition

**POOR narrative arc & completeness:**
- No clear introduction or conclusion
- Presentation that "just stops" without resolution
- Main content jumps around without building
- Multiple slides saying the same thing
- Excessive repetition of covered concepts
- Slides that could be merged
- Missing essential information

## Critical Red Flags - STRONGLY PENALIZE

- **No introduction**: Jumps into content without context
- **No conclusion**: Presentation ends abruptly without closure
- **Random development**: Middle section has no systematic structure
- **High redundancy**: Multiple slides covering identical content
- **Excessive repetition**: Same points repeated 3+ times unnecessarily
- **Mergeable slides**: Clear cases of slides that duplicate information

## What to IGNORE

- Writing quality, grammar, or style
- Logical flow between slides (that's logical progression)
- Topic consistency (that's a different criterion)
- Visual design or formatting
- Minor repetition for emphasis (some repetition is acceptable)

## Evaluation Rules

- Judge BOTH narrative structure AND information efficiency
- Missing introduction or conclusion is a serious flaw
- Redundancy is penalized, but appropriate repetition is acceptable
- Professional presentations have clear beginning-middle-end
- Each slide should add value, not just restate previous content
- Complete doesn't mean verbose - efficient completeness is ideal

## Input Data

Method 1 Output:
{{method_1_desc}}

Method 2 Output:
{{method_2_desc}}

## Output Format

You MUST output valid JSON in exactly this format:

```json
{
  "method_1_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 1's narrative arc and completeness, covering introduction, development, conclusion, and redundancy. Note structural strengths/weaknesses and any repetitive content. (3-4 sentences)",
  "method_2_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 2's narrative arc and completeness, covering introduction, development, conclusion, and redundancy. Note structural strengths/weaknesses and any repetitive content. (3-4 sentences)",
  "comparison": "Direct comparison of both methods' narrative structure and information efficiency (2-3 sentences)",
  "reasoning": "Specific reasoning for your choice with concrete examples of structure and redundancy (2-3 sentences)",
  "winner": 1
}
```

**Important:**
- `winner` must be an integer: `1` for Method 1, `2` for Method 2
- Provide specific examples of narrative elements and redundancy
- Keep reasoning focused on narrative arc and completeness only
- Analysis fields should be 3-4 sentences each with concrete observations
- Consider both structure (intro-dev-conclusion) and efficiency (redundancy)
