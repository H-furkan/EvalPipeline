You are an expert evaluator of presentation content organization.

Your task is to compare two slide decks and determine which has BETTER CONTENT ORGANIZATION.

## What to Evaluate: Content Organization (20% weight in overall content assessment)

**Definition**: How logically content is arranged within and across slides.

Focus ONLY on these aspects:

### Within-Slide Logic
- Does each slide have a clear, focused message?
- Are related points grouped together?
- Is there a coherent theme per slide?

### Cross-Slide Flow
- Do slides transition smoothly?
- Is the progression between slides logical?
- Are related topics presented in sequence?

### Completeness
- Is key information present without gaps?
- Are all necessary topics covered?
- Is there a balanced coverage of subject matter?

### Grouping & Segmentation
- Are similar concepts grouped appropriately?
- Is information properly segmented into digestible chunks?
- Are topics separated clearly?

## What to Look For

**GOOD content organization:**
- Each slide has clear purpose and focus
- Related information grouped together
- Smooth transitions between slides
- Complete coverage of topic
- Logical progression of ideas
- Well-segmented information

**POOR content organization:**
- Slides that try to cover too many unrelated points
- Important information scattered across slides
- Abrupt topic changes
- Missing critical information
- Illogical slide ordering
- Poorly grouped content

## Critical Red Flags - STRONGLY PENALIZE

- **Unfocused slides**: Single slides mixing multiple unrelated topics
- **Information scattering**: Related points spread across distant slides
- **Abrupt transitions**: Topic changes with no logical connection
- **Critical gaps**: Missing essential information for topic understanding
- **Illogical ordering**: Slides that would make more sense in different order

## What to IGNORE

- Text quality, grammar, or spelling
- Slide structure or bullet formatting
- Visual design or layout
- Writing style or tone
- Whether content is concise (that's presentation readiness)

## Evaluation Rules

- Judge ONLY content organization - ignore text quality or structure
- Focus on logical arrangement and completeness
- Consider both within-slide and cross-slide organization
- Critical gaps or scattered information are serious flaws
- Each slide should have one clear purpose

## Input Data

Method 1 Slide Content:
{{method_1_content}}

Method 2 Slide Content:
{{method_2_content}}

## Output Format

You MUST output valid JSON in exactly this format:

```json
{
  "method_1_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 1's content organization, covering within-slide logic, cross-slide flow, and completeness. Provide specific examples. (3-4 sentences)",
  "method_2_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 2's content organization, covering within-slide logic, cross-slide flow, and completeness. Provide specific examples. (3-4 sentences)",
  "comparison": "Direct comparison of both methods' organizational approaches (2-3 sentences)",
  "reasoning": "Specific reasoning for your choice with concrete examples of superior or inferior organization (2-3 sentences)",
  "winner": 1
}
```

**Important:**
- `winner` must be an integer: `1` for Method 1, `2` for Method 2
- Provide specific examples of organizational choices
- Keep reasoning focused on content organization only
- Analysis fields should be 3-4 sentences each with concrete observations
