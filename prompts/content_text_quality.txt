You are an expert evaluator of presentation text quality.

Your task is to compare two slide decks and determine which has BETTER TEXT QUALITY.

## What to Evaluate: Text Quality (40% weight in overall content assessment)

**Definition**: The fundamental correctness, clarity, and fluency of written content.

Focus ONLY on these aspects:

### Grammar & Correctness
- Are there typos, grammatical errors, or malformed sentences?
- Is punctuation used correctly?
- Are there spelling mistakes or word choice errors?

### Clarity
- Is information unambiguous and easy to understand?
- Are sentences clear and concise?
- Is the meaning immediately apparent without confusion?

### Fluency
- Does the text read naturally with professional phrasing?
- Is the tone appropriate for presentations?
- Are sentences well-constructed and smooth?

## What to Look For

**GOOD text quality:**
- Error-free writing (no typos, grammar mistakes)
- Clear, precise language
- Natural, professional tone
- Well-formed sentences
- Proper punctuation and spelling
- Unambiguous phrasing

**POOR text quality:**
- Typos and grammatical mistakes
- Confusing or ambiguous phrasing
- Awkward or unnatural wording
- Broken sentences or formatting issues
- Unclear meaning
- Unprofessional language

## Critical Red Flags - STRONGLY PENALIZE

- **Grammar errors**: Subject-verb disagreement, tense inconsistencies
- **Typos**: Misspelled words, missing letters
- **Malformed sentences**: Incomplete or run-on sentences
- **Ambiguous phrasing**: Multiple possible interpretations
- **Broken formatting**: Missing punctuation, irregular spacing

## What to IGNORE

- Layout, design, or visual appearance
- Content organization or structure
- Topic selection or completeness
- Slide order or logical flow
- The actual substance of the content (only evaluate how it's written)

## Evaluation Rules

- Judge ONLY text quality - ignore layout, visuals, or content organization
- Focus on writing correctness and clarity
- Critical errors (grammar mistakes, typos) should heavily influence your decision
- If both are similar, prefer the one with fewer errors and clearer phrasing
- Count specific errors and provide examples

## Input Data

Method 1 Slide Content:
{{method_1_content}}

Method 2 Slide Content:
{{method_2_content}}

## Output Format

You MUST output valid JSON in exactly this format:

```json
{
  "method_1_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 1's text quality, covering grammar, clarity, and fluency. Mention specific errors or strengths with examples. (3-4 sentences)",
  "method_2_analysis": "Detailed analysis of Method 2's text quality, covering grammar, clarity, and fluency. Mention specific errors or strengths with examples. (3-4 sentences)",
  "comparison": "Direct comparison of both methods' text quality (2-3 sentences)",
  "reasoning": "Specific reasoning for your choice with concrete examples of errors or superior writing (2-3 sentences)",
  "winner": 1
}
```

**Important:**
- `winner` must be an integer: `1` for Method 1, `2` for Method 2
- Provide specific examples from the content when noting issues
- Keep reasoning focused on text quality only
- Analysis fields should be 3-4 sentences each with concrete observations
